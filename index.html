    <meta name="description" content="I'm an entreprenuer with a speciality in multi-stakeholder, full cycle sales. I've started three companies, and went through Y Combinator's S'24 batch with my most recent one. I've started companies that sold into independent schools, restaurants, and HR/Payroll companies. In my free time, I like to work with companies to help them with their positioning, messaging, and GTM.
